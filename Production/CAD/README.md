# Production CAD Files

This directory contains production-ready STL files for 3D printing the HexadecipadV2 case.

## Files

- **Case bottom.stl** - Bottom housing of the case
- **Case top.stl** - Top housing/cover of the case
- **Plate.stl** - Switch mounting plate (goes between top and bottom)

## 3D Printing Recommendations

### Settings
- **Layer Height:** 0.2mm (or 0.15mm for better surface finish)
- **Infill:** 20% or higher
- **Wall Thickness:** 3-4 perimeters
- **Top/Bottom Layers:** 4-5 layers


### Print Orientation
Orient parts to minimize supports and maximize strength. The plate should be printed flat for dimensional accuracy.
