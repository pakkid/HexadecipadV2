# 3D Models

This directory contains STEP files of electronic components used in the HexadecipadV2 design.

## Files

- **asm_mx_asm_PCB.stp** - Complete assembly model of MX mechanical keyboard switch with PCB mounting
- **Encoder.STEP** - 3D model of the rotary encoder component
- **Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 v26.step** - 3D model of the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 microcontroller board (version 26)

## Usage

These STEP models are used for:
- Verifying mechanical clearances in CAD assemblies
- Creating accurate renders and visualizations
- Checking component fit and interference
- PCB 3D visualization in KiCad

These files can be imported into most CAD software packages including KiCad, Fusion 360, SolidWorks, and FreeCAD.
